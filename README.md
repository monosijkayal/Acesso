# 🔐 Acesso - Multi-Factor Authentication Smart Contract

**Acesso** is a Solidity smart contract that implements multi-factor authentication (MFA) on-chain using hashed passwords and OTPs (One-Time Passwords). This adds an additional layer of security for dApps by requiring users to authenticate with two separate factors.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Registration:** Register with a securely hashed password.
- **OTP Submission:** Submit hashed OTPs as the second authentication factor.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Authenticate users only when both password and OTP hashes match.
- **Authentication Status:** Check whether a user is currently authenticated.
- **Event Emissions:** Logs key actions such as registrations, OTP submissions, and successful authentications for transparency.
